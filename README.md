# Dotfiles (Andr√© Markwalder)

My OS X and Ubuntu dotfiles.


## How to install

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL raw.github.com/amarkwalder/dotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)"
```

N.B. If you wish to fork this project and maintain your own dotfiles, you must
substitute my username for your own in the above command and the 2 variables
found at the top of the `bin/dotfiles` script.

## How to update

You should run the update when:

* You make a change to `~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig` (the only file that is
  copied rather than symlinked).
* You want to pull changes from the remote repository.
* You want to update Homebrew formulae, Ubuntu packages and / or Node packages.

Run the dotfiles command:

```bash
$ dotfiles
```
